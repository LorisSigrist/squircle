# Svelte Panels
Svelte panels is a Panel Manager for desktop like apps written in svelte. 

Many Desktop Apps use panel-based layouts. Examples include Blender and Visual Studio Code. If you want your webapps to feel more native-like, being able to make use of such panel-based layouts can be helpful.

This library was written mainly for the squircle animator, but can be used as a standalone package.

## Installation
```bash
npm install svelte-panels
```
